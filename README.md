# Metapath-based Heterogeneous Graph-Transformer Network (MHGphormer)

This is the official Pytorch implementation of the Metapath-based Heterogeneous Graph-Transformer Network (MHGphormer), which is proposed in our paper [Joint Spectrum, Precoding, and Phase Shifts Design for RIS-Aided Multiuser MIMO THz Systems](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=hxEIgUXLFF) accepted for publication in *IEEE Transactions on Communications* 2024.

## Installation

First check the requirements as follows:\
python=3.7\
numpy=1.17.0\
pytorch=1.12.1\
cudatoolkit = 11.3.1\
wandb=0.12.19\
torchvision=0.13.1\


Then clone the repository as follows:
```shell
[git clone https://github.com/Ali-Meh619/MHGphormer.git]
```
